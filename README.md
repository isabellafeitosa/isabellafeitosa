Legal facilitator. Emphasis on Business Immersion. Risk management. Visual law. Innovation. Productivity.

I'm a lawyer. I'm human. I love my country. I believe in effective advocacy, focused on results.
I could not study abroad during graduation to attend a public institution. I enjoyed every moment. I did robust stages to see wide. I worked and found myself in business management. Results. Growth. Less bureaucracy, more effectiveness. The walk made me understand that after graduation there is depth to select our path and the dots connected! I worked with medium and large companies. I designed my business model with the help of Sebrae. I was no longer the same. I grew on new ground, with God's help, until I took on greater responsibilities and my business began to be sustainable. Until I was challenged to pause the route, focusing energies on a highly relevant and significant research work for small and medium-sized companies in the country, in the Brasil Mais Productivo program, Sebrae/CNPQ. Here I am for an hour. More than 80 companies have already been served and monitored directly in the last year and the story continues, with the certainty of purpose and a journey that has been guided until now and will continue to be.
Happiness and gratitude.
